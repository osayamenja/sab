# Running SAB
## Requirements
- Create a conda or virtual environment
- Install [CausalNex](https://causalnex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02_getting_started/02_install.html) and matplotlib.

After completing the above, see the `walkthrough` notebook. It is self-contained including:
- The complete implementation of the SAB pipeline
- Code to use and evaluate the pipeline.
- Code to generate all plots.

We also include real-world Kaggle datasets in the `datasets` directory, so feel free to get started!
